# Leyla Nobatova – Artist Portfolio

## About Me
I am **Leyla Nobatova**, a visual artist exploring the intersection of **geometry, color, and narrative**.  

Born in Turkmenistan, raised in Ukraine, and now based in San Francisco, I bring a cross-cultural perspective to contemporary painting. With both parents as visual artists, I was introduced to creative practice early before pursuing a career in technology. Since 2016 I have developed a body of work spanning digital illustration, watercolor, and acrylics on canvas.  

Influenced by a formative calligraphy study in Japan, my current practice integrates Japanese ink with bold black outlines to define form and narrative. My works belong to a visual language I call *Shapes & Stories*, which explores both abstraction and memory.

I am currently preparing works for collectors, open calls, and residencies.
