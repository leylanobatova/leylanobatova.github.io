## About Me
I am **Leyla Nobatova**, a visual artist exploring the intersection of **geometry, color, and narrative**.

My practice combines acrylics, mixed media, and Japanese ink overlays to create a visual language of *Shapes & Stories*.  

I am based in San Francisco and currently preparing works for collectors, open calls, and residencies.
